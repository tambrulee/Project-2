Hello and welcome to my README for Project 2 - Sort'd

This is a project which will utilise Javascript to create a daily to-do-list! At this point the user will not be able to login and store the data, but this can be part of a future project unless I find myself with time on my hands!

## User Stories

### Core Functionality
As a user, I want to add tasks to my to-do list, so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

As a user, I want to tick off completed tasks, so that I can visually see what I’ve finished.

As a user, I want to drag and drop tasks, so that I can prioritise or reorder them easily.

As a user, I want to remove tasks from my list, so that I can keep my to-do list clean and relevant.

### Testing

### Usability & Preferences
As a user, I want to hide or unhide completed tasks, so that I can focus on what still needs doing.

As a user, I want to change the theme colour, so that the interface feels more personal or fun to use.

As a user, I want my tasks to stay saved even after I close the tab, so that I don’t lose progress (via localStorage).

### Testing

### Accessibility & Feedback
As a user, I want to see a message or indicator when a task is added or removed, so that I know my actions have worked.

As a user, I want to navigate the to-do list easily on desktop and mobile, so I can use it wherever I am.

### Testing

## Core Features
- Add tasks — basic input + button to add to list.
- Drag-and-drop tasks — reorder tasks visually.
- Checkboxes for completion — toggle task done/undone styles.
- Hide/unhide tasks — toggle visibility of the entire task list.
- Theme color changer — button to cycle or pick from predefined colors.

### Testing



## Wireframes

I intend to use Bootstrap for the main layout.


## Dependencies

### Drag and Drop API
* <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API"> You can read the Drag and Drop API Docs here<a>

To implement this I had to create a drop zone so I duplicated one of the text box elements.
