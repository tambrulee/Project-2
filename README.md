Hello and welcome to my README for Project 2 - Sort'd

This is a project which will utilise Javascript to create a daily to-do-list! At this point the user will not be able to login and store the data, but this can be part of a future project unless I find myself with time on my hands!

## Core Features
- Add tasks — basic input + button to add to list.
- Drag-and-drop tasks — reorder tasks visually.
- Checkboxes for completion — toggle task done/undone styles.
- Hide/unhide tasks — toggle visibility of the entire task list.
- Theme color changer — button to cycle or pick from predefined colors.

## Wireframes

I intend to use Bootstrap for the main layout.
